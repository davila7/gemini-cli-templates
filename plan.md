# Gemini CLI Dashboard Plan

## Objective

Create a command-line tool that launches a web-based dashboard to display real-time analytics from the Gemini CLI.

## Background

The Gemini CLI uses OpenTelemetry to collect and export telemetry data to a local Jaeger instance. This data is stored in a temporary directory within the user's `.gemini` configuration folder.

## Plan

1.  **Project Setup:**
    *   Initialize a new Node.js project.
    *   Install necessary dependencies:
        *   `express`: To create the web server.
        *   `http-proxy-middleware`: To proxy requests to the Jaeger API.
        *   `concurrently`: To run the web server and the Jaeger instance at the same time.

2.  **Dashboard Development:**
    *   Create a simple HTML page to serve as the dashboard.
    *   Use JavaScript to fetch data from the Jaeger API and display it on the page.
    *   The dashboard will display a list of recent Gemini CLI commands and their execution times.

3.  **Tooling:**
    *   Create a new `npx` command that:
        *   Starts the Jaeger instance.
        *   Starts the web server.
        *   Opens the dashboard in the user's default browser.

4.  **Packaging:**
    *   Configure the `package.json` file to define the `npx` command.
    *   Publish the package to npm.

## Next Steps

*   Create the initial project structure.
*   Implement the web server and the dashboard.
*   Configure the `npx` command.
*   Test the tool locally.
*   Publish the package to npm.
